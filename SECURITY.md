# Security Policy

This security policy outlines our commitment to security in this project/repository hosted on GitHub. It provides guidelines for reporting security vulnerabilities, our response process, and best practices for maintaining security. We take security seriously and appreciate the community's help in identifying and addressing potential issues.

## Scope

This policy applies to all code, documentation, and assets in this repository. It covers vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the project or its users. Out-of-scope issues include:
- Denial-of-service attacks that do not lead to unauthorized access or data loss.
- Social engineering attacks.
- Issues in third-party dependencies (report those to the respective maintainers).
- Non-security bugs (use the Issues tab for those).

If you're unsure whether an issue is in scope, please report it anyway, and we'll evaluate it.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of the project:

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 0.x     | Yes (current)      |


Use a supported version to ensure you receive the latest security patches. We recommend always using the latest stable release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly. Do not disclose the issue publicly until we've had a chance to address it.

### How to Report
- **Preferred Method**: Submit a report via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature. Go to the "Security" tab and click "Report a vulnerability."
- **Alternative**: Email us at [info@mail.dimasfahmi.pro]. Use a subject line like "Security Vulnerability Report."

*Do not open a public issue on GitHub for security vulnerabilities, as this could expose users before a fix is available.*

### What to Include in Your Report
To help us triage and fix the issue quickly, please provide:
- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (e.g., code snippets, screenshots, or a minimal reproducible example).
- The potential impact (e.g., data exposure, remote code execution).
- Affected versions or components.
- Any proof-of-concept code (but do not exploit it in production).
- Your contact information for follow-up questions.

### Response Expectations
- **Acknowledgment**: We will confirm receipt of your report within 3 business days.
- **Triage**: We'll assess the severity and validity within 7 days.
- **Fix Timeline**: For critical issues, we aim to release a fix ASAP; for high-severity issues, we aim to release a fix within 30 days; for lower-severity, up to 90 days.
- **Updates**: We'll keep you informed of progress.
- **Credit**: If you wish, we'll credit you in the release notes or security advisory after the fix is public.

If we determine the report is not a vulnerability or out of scope, we'll explain why.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

We follow a coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) process:
1. Receive and acknowledge the report.
2. Validate and reproduce the issue.
3. Develop and test a fix.
4. Release the fix via a new version or patch.
5. Publish a security advisory on GitHub (under the "Security" tab) detailing the vulnerability, affected versions, and mitigation steps.
6. Optionally, request a CVE ID if the issue warrants it.

We ask reporters to wait until the advisory is published before disclosing details publicly. In return, we commit to timely fixes and transparency.

## Safe Harbor

We support good-faith security research. If you follow this policy when discovering and reporting an issue:
- We will not pursue legal action against you.
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue.
- We consider your research as authorized under our safe harbor terms.

This does not grant permission for malicious activities, such as disrupting services or accessing unauthorized data.


## Contact
